Upon launching our Flask application, users are welcomed with a login page offering two distinct pathways: existing users can seamlessly log in to access the homepage, while newcomers are directed to a convenient sign-up page through a prominently placed link. Once registered, users gain access to the homepage, a hub offering four essential links: About, Contact Us, Log Out, and Home.
The About page succinctly encapsulates our website's purpose and mission, providing a brief yet informative description. Meanwhile, the Contact Us section serves as a comprehensive resource, featuring links to our social media profiles, phone number, physical address, and email for easy communication.
To ensure user control, the Log Out link gracefully logs users out of their sessions, maintaining privacy and security. Additionally, across all pages, a prominent "Get Started" button guides users to our visually captivating intro page. This introductory section is adorned with stunning visuals that captivate the user's attention, leading them seamlessly into a well-crafted questionnaire.
This questionnaire serves a critical function, aiding in identifying user preferences through a series of thoughtfully designed questions. Upon completion and submission, our state-of-the-art algorithm springs into action. Although limited by the size of our database, we focus on three key questions: cost, continent, and desired features.
By utilizing these three criteria for database filtration, we ensure a balanced approach. While using all questions might narrow down the options excessively, our approach strives to deliver meaningful destination suggestions. In scenarios where no destination meets the specified criteria, our website tactfully communicates this by displaying a message indicating that no suitable destinations were found. This transparent approach ensures users understand the limitations while appreciating the website's efforts to cater to their preferences.
